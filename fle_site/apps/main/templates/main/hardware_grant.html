            <h2>Kolibri Hardware Grants Program</h2><br>
            <p>With a commitment to reaching learners in connectivity-scarce environments, we are bringing our new open source platform, Kolibri, to learners who are otherwise unable to access high quality educational content.<br><br>

            Supported by funding from Google.org, the “Kolibri Hardware Grants Program” provides organizations with a grant of up to $15,000 USD for the purchase of necessary hardware to implement Kolibri in formal schools, educational facilities, and non-formal learning settings to reach both school-aged and adult learners. Our goal is to learn more about the many ways that Kolibri can be used to bring education to learners around the world who need it most. Grantees will receive personalized support to test and pilot Kolibri in their programs in addition to the hardware, which may also be used for other programming needs.<br><br>

            We will work closely with our grantees to ensure that they are supported in using Kolibri to address the needs of their community. Users with unique user types and hardware configurations in their context are encouraged to apply. <br><br>

            Applications for our most recent round of grants closed on January 19th. If you are interested in being notified about our next round of applications, please <a href="https://learningequality.us6.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=023b9af05922dfc7f47a4fffb&id=d56041116d" target="_blank">sign up for our mailing list</a>.
